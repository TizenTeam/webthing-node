# WEBTHING-IOTJS #


## INTRODUCTION: ##


## USAGE: ##


### USING TIZENRT: ###

IoT.js is part of Tizen:RT, but current release is oudated, 
so it needs to be updated:


### USING IOTJS ON GNU/LINUX: ###

Only snapshot version if currently supported, 
if using GNU/Linux rebuild it from scratch or install snapshot debian packages:

### USING NODEJS: ###

For debuging purposes, code is also compatible with nodejs but with stubbed IO function,
in longer term I plan to align iotjs API for IO modules for node.
